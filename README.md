Almost ready! Now, you need to host the server that will handle the hack.

## Node.js Server

I will be using [repl.it](https://replit.com/), a free hosting platform.

## üêû Possible errors


- **Error: Server unavailable or invalid URL!**
This error only happens if the server is down, or you didn't configure it correctly, or you entered the wrong url.
It is recommended to check the tutorial above again.
- **loading infinitely**
Try to go back to the duolingo menu and start the lesson again, if it persists, check if the server is turned on.
